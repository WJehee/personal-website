Blot is a platform for running games that involve maps in some way.  
The core of the project is built with:
- [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)
- [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/)
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/)

<!--TODO: Explain sinterkest en nieuw-->
This project started as a fun game idea for the yearly "sinterkerst & nieuw" event at the scouting I volunteer at.
The idea was to have a battle-royale style game where players have to collect caches of point within an ever-shrinking circle.
These points could then later be used to "purchase" gifts.  
We elaborated on the idea by introducing powerups that can be collected and used against the other players.

The game was such a great success that I got several requests to play it again, but also to make different versions.
That's when I decided to generalize the design a bit more other game modes.

Currently I am working on improving the core of the project and implementing more game modes to be tested and played in the future.
