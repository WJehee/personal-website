## NixOS

My computers all run NixOS, [my config](https://github.com/WJehee/.garland) shows all the tools and configuration I use in more detail.  
I use [Stylix](https://github.com/danth/stylix) for theming my setup.  
The most important of which are outlined below:

- Editor: [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)
- Window manager: [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/)
- Status bar: [Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar)
- Launcher: [Wofi](https://hg.sr.ht/~scoopta/wofi)
- Shell: [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) / [nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/)
- Terminal emulator: [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)
- Browser: [Librewolf](https://librewolf.net/)
- Font: [Geist](https://vercel.com/font) for both sans-serif and monospace

### Development

I use git for version control but have recently taking a liking to [jujutsu](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj).
My (new) repositories always contain a Nix flake as well as a [Justfile](https://github.com/casey/just).

I mostly develop software in the following languages:

- Rust
- Elixir
- Python
- Zig
- Gleam
