I'm a MSc. Computer Science specialized in cybersecurity, based in the Netherlands.

I like <span class="purple">hacking</span>
(both the <span class="blue">making</span> and <span class="red">breaking</span> kind, TODO: make this show on hover)
on devices in the harshest of environments.

And yes, I probably spent way too much time on this website.
